Admin Impersonation Feature Implementation Guide
Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step implementation plan for adding an impersonation feature that allows admins to impersonate any user in the system. This will help with debugging, support, and administrative control.
Current Architecture Analysis
Authentication System
Client-side: Uses AuthService class with localStorage for session management
Server-side: Uses createApiAuthMiddleware() for API route protection
User Types: admin, team_lead, project_manager, employee
Session Storage: localStorage with keys: adminUser, employeeId, authSession
Key Components
lib/auth.ts - Main authentication service
lib/api-auth.ts - API authentication middleware
Layout components with role-based access control
Employee management system with full CRUD operations
Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Core Impersonation Infrastructure
Step 1: Extend AuthService for Impersonation
File: lib/auth.ts
Tasks:
Add impersonation fields to AuthUser interface:
isImpersonating?: boolean
originalUser?: { id: string, email: string, role: string }
Add new methods to AuthService class:
startImpersonation(targetUserId: string, targetUserData: any): AuthUser
stopImpersonation(): AuthUser | null
isImpersonating(): boolean
getOriginalUser(): AuthUser | null
Add new localStorage key: IMPERSONATION_KEY = 'impersonationSession'
Update getCurrentUser() to handle impersonation state
Step 2: Create Impersonation API Endpoints
File: app/api/admin/impersonation/route.ts
Tasks:
Create POST endpoint for starting impersonation:
Validate admin permissions
Fetch target user data from database
Log impersonation action in audit table
Return target user data
Create DELETE endpoint for stopping impersonation:
Validate admin permissions
Log impersonation end action
Return success response
Add proper error handling and validation
Step 3: Create Impersonation UI Component
File: components/admin/ImpersonationModal.tsx
Tasks:
Create modal component with:
Employee search and filtering
Department and role filters
Employee list with selection
Warning message about impersonation
Confirmation buttons
Include features:
Real-time search
Employee details display
Role-based color coding
Responsive design
Phase 2: Admin Dashboard Integration
Step 4: Add Impersonation Controls to Admin Dashboard
File: app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx
Tasks:
Add impersonation state management:
showImpersonationModal state
isImpersonating state
originalUser state
Add impersonation UI elements:
Impersonation button in header
Impersonation status indicator
"Stop Impersonation" button when active
Add impersonation handlers:
handleStartImpersonation()
handleStopImpersonation()
Route redirection logic
Step 5: Update Admin Layout
File: app/admin/layout.tsx
Tasks:
Add impersonation status to header
Add impersonation controls to navigation
Update role checking to handle impersonation state
Phase 3: Database Schema Updates
Step 6: Create Audit Log Table
File: scripts/create-audit-log-table.sql
Tasks:
Create admin_audit_logs table with fields:
id (UUID, primary key)
admin_id (UUID, foreign key to employees)
action (VARCHAR, e.g., 'impersonation_start', 'impersonation_end')
target_user_id (UUID, nullable)
details (JSONB)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)
Add appropriate indexes for performance
Step 7: Update Employee Queries
Tasks:
Update employee API endpoints to handle impersonation context
Ensure proper data filtering based on impersonated user
Add impersonation metadata to responses
Phase 4: Security and Access Control
Step 8: Update API Authentication Middleware
File: lib/api-auth.ts
Tasks:
Extend createApiAuthMiddleware() to handle impersonation
Add impersonation context to API responses
Ensure proper permission checking for impersonated users
Step 9: Update Route Protection
Tasks:
Update layout components to handle impersonation state
Modify role-based access control
Add impersonation indicators to protected routes
Phase 5: User Experience Enhancements
Step 10: Add Impersonation Indicators
Tasks:
Add visual indicators throughout the app when impersonating
Update page titles and breadcrumbs
Add impersonation banner/header
Step 11: Add Impersonation to Employee Management
File: app/admin/employees/page.tsx
Tasks:
Add "Impersonate" button to employee list
Add impersonation action to employee detail pages
Update employee search to include impersonation option
Phase 6: Testing and Validation
Step 12: Create Test Cases
Tasks:
Test impersonation start/stop functionality
Test role-based access during impersonation
Test audit logging
Test UI state management
Step 13: Security Testing
Tasks:
Verify only admins can impersonate
Test impersonation session management
Verify audit trail completeness
Test edge cases and error scenarios

Security Considerations
Audit Trail: All impersonation actions must be logged
Session Management: Proper handling of original vs impersonated sessions
Permission Validation: Ensure only admins can impersonate
Data Isolation: Proper data filtering based on impersonated user
Session Timeout: Consider shorter timeouts for impersonated sessions
Performance Considerations
Caching: Cache employee lists for impersonation modal
Database Queries: Optimize queries for impersonation context
State Management: Efficient handling of impersonation state
UI Updates: Minimize re-renders during impersonation
Future Enhancements
Bulk Impersonation: Impersonate multiple users for testing
