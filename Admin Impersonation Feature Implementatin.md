# Admin Impersonation Feature Implementation

## Overview
The admin impersonation feature allows administrators to temporarily assume the identity of other users for troubleshooting and support purposes. This feature includes comprehensive audit logging for security and compliance.

## Issue Resolution
**Problem**: The impersonation API was failing with the error `relation "admin_audit_logs" does not exist`

**Root Cause**: The `admin_audit_logs` table was referenced in the code but had not been created in the database.

**Solution**: 
1. Created the missing `admin_audit_logs` table using the existing migration script
2. Updated the table references to use `employees_new` instead of `employees` to match the current database schema
3. Verified the table creation and functionality

## Database Schema

### admin_audit_logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE admin_audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    admin_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES employees_new(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    action VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    target_user_id UUID REFERENCES employees_new(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    details JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Indexes
- `admin_audit_logs_pkey` (Primary key)
- `idx_admin_audit_logs_admin_id` (Admin ID lookup)
- `idx_admin_audit_logs_action` (Action type lookup)
- `idx_admin_audit_logs_created_at` (Timestamp sorting)
- `idx_admin_audit_logs_target_user_id` (Target user lookup)

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/admin/impersonation
**Purpose**: Start impersonating a user

**Request Body**:
```json
{
  "targetUserId": "uuid-of-target-user"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "targetUser": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "employee_id": "string",
    "email": "string",
    "first_name": "string",
    "last_name": "string",
    "role": "string",
    "department": "string",
    "position": "string"
  }
}
```

**Audit Log**: Creates an entry with action `impersonation_start`

### DELETE /api/admin/impersonation
**Purpose**: Stop impersonation

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Audit Log**: Creates an entry with action `impersonation_end`

## Security Features

1. **Role-based Access Control**: Only users with `admin` role can use impersonation
2. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All impersonation actions are logged with:
   - Admin ID performing the action
   - Target user ID being impersonated
   - Action type (start/end)
   - Timestamp
   - Additional details in JSON format
3. **User Validation**: Target users must exist and be active
4. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid authentication

## Audit Log Details

### impersonation_start
```json
{
  "target_user_email": "user@example.com",
  "target_user_role": "employee",
  "admin_email": "admin@example.com"
}
```

### impersonation_end
```json
{
  "admin_email": "admin@example.com",
  "action": "impersonation_stopped"
}
```

## Implementation Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - All functionality is working correctly

- Database table created and verified
- API endpoints functional
- Audit logging operational
- Security measures in place
- Tested with real data

## Files Modified
- `scripts/create-audit-log-table.sql` - Updated to reference `employees_new`
- `app/api/admin/impersonation/route.ts` - No changes needed, was already correct

## Testing
The feature has been tested with:
- Real admin and target users from the database
- Audit log entry creation and verification
- Both start and end impersonation actions
- Proper error handling and validation
