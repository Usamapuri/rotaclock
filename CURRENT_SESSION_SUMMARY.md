# Database Consolidation Project - Current Session Summary

## 🎯 **Project Goal**
Complete database schema consolidation by removing all legacy tables (`*_new` suffixes), unifying time tracking, and ensuring all API endpoints and tests work with the canonical schema.

## ✅ **Major Accomplishments This Session**

### **1. Database Migration Completed** ✅
- Executed destructive migration to remove `_new` table suffixes
- Unified time tracking into single `time_entries` table
- Added proper `tenant_id` columns and indexes

### **2. Complete API Endpoint Migration** ✅ 
- Updated **50+ API endpoints** to use canonical table names
- Migrated all core functionality:
  - Time tracking (`/api/time/*`)
  - Shift management (`/api/shifts/*`, `/api/scheduling/*`)
  - Employee management (`/api/employees/*`)
  - Admin endpoints (`/api/admin/*`)
  - Team lead endpoints (`/api/team-lead/*`)
  - Dashboard and data endpoints

### **3. Frontend Component Updates** ✅
- Updated dashboard components to use new field names
- Fixed time tracking display logic
- Maintained backward compatibility where needed

### **4. Test Infrastructure Fixes** ✅
- Fixed Jest configuration issues
- Resolved NextResponse mocking problems
- Fixed `mockImplementation is not a function` errors in 11 test files
- Excluded Playwright tests from Jest runs

## 📊 **Current Test Status**
- **Before:** 43 failed, 16 passed tests
- **After:** 42 failed, 20 passed tests
- **Test Suites:** 12 failed, 3 passed, 15 total

## 🔧 **Remaining Issues (For Next Session)**

### **1. Team Lead Authorization (Priority: HIGH)**
- **Problem:** Team lead API tests returning 403 instead of 200
- **Root Cause:** Jest mocks not being applied to actual API routes
- **Files Affected:** `__tests__/api/team-lead/*.test.ts`
- **Potential Solutions:**
  - Try manual mocks in `__mocks__` directory
  - Mock at database level instead of auth level
  - Investigate Jest module resolution issues

### **2. Database Connection Errors (Priority: MEDIUM)**
- **Problem:** Tests attempting real database connections
- **Error:** "The server does not support SSL connections"
- **Solution:** Improve database function mocking

### **3. Field Name Mismatches (Priority: LOW)**
- **Problem:** Some test mock data still uses old field names
- **Examples:** `clock_in_time` vs `clock_in`, `break_time_used` vs `break_hours`
- **Solution:** Scan and update remaining test files

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**
- [ ] All Jest tests passing (0 failed tests)
- [ ] No database connection attempts in tests
- [ ] Team lead authorization working in tests
- [ ] All field names consistent with new schema

## 📁 **Key Files Updated This Session**
- `lib/database.ts` - Complete refactor to canonical tables
- `scripts/destructive_consolidation_migration.sql` - Migration script
- `scripts/run-destructive-migration.js` - Migration runner
- 50+ API route files - All migrated to new schema
- Multiple frontend components - Field name updates
- 11 test files - Fixed mock implementation patterns
- `jest.config.js` - Configuration improvements

## 🚀 **Next Steps (Priority Order)**
1. **Fix Jest module mocking** for team lead authorization
2. **Resolve database connection errors** in tests
3. **Complete field name updates** in remaining test files
4. **Run performance validation** on key endpoints
5. **Final cleanup** and documentation updates

## 💡 **Key Learnings**
- Jest module mocking requires creating mock functions before `jest.mock()` calls
- Database migration was successful but test mocking needs different approach
- Frontend compatibility maintained through proxy endpoints
- Significant progress made but test suite needs focused debugging session

---

**Status:** Ready for next session to focus on remaining test issues
**Estimated Completion:** 1-2 more focused sessions on test debugging

## 🔄 This Session (continued)

- Added a safe global mock for `pg.Pool` in `__tests__/setup.ts` to prevent real DB connections and eliminate SSL errors during tests.
- Fixed team-lead tests to import route handlers after mocks and updated leave status to `denied` (schema-aligned).
- Ran targeted team-lead tests; DB errors are gone, but handlers still bypass test mocks for `lib/api-auth`/`lib/database`, causing 401/404 outcomes.

### Blocker
- Module mocks for `@/lib/api-auth` and `@/lib/database` aren’t applied reliably to route handlers.

### Next Actions
1) Add manual mocks:
   - `__mocks__/lib/api-auth.ts` exporting jest-backed `createApiAuthMiddleware`/role guards.
   - `__mocks__/lib/database.ts` exporting jest-backed `query`, `getTeamByLead`, etc.
2) Refactor team-lead tests to use `jest.mock('@/lib/api-auth')` and `jest.mock('@/lib/database')` without factories and drive behavior via the manual mocks’ jest fns.
3) Re-run only team-lead tests; then proceed to shifts and admin tenant tests.
