# Multi-Tenant SaaS Implementation Progress

## üéØ Project Overview
Transform Rota Cloud from a single-tenant application to a multi-tenant SaaS platform with:
- **Pricing**: $2/month per organization (first month free)
- **Multi-tenancy**: Complete data isolation between organizations
- **Self-service**: Organizations can sign up and manage their own accounts
- **Demo accounts**: Preserved for showcasing the application

## üöÄ Current Status: **Phase 4 complete; beginning Phase 5**

### Next Immediate Steps:
1. Begin Phase 5.1: introduce a TenantContext provider and wire data fetchers
2. Start Phase 3.2: implement Stripe subscription scaffolding and webhooks
3. Add integration tests for end-to-end tenant isolation

### Estimated Timeline:
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days (Database foundation)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days (Authentication & Organization management)
- **Phase 3**: 4-5 days (Pricing & Subscription)
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 days (API updates)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 days (Frontend updates)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 days (Demo preservation)
- **Phase 7**: 2-3 days (Testing)
- **Phase 8**: 1-2 days (Deployment)

**Total Estimated Time**: 18-26 days

## üìä Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero data leakage between tenants
- [ ] Successful subscription processing
- [ ] Demo accounts remain functional
- [ ] Performance maintained with multiple tenants
- [ ] 99.9% uptime during launch

---

## üîß Technical Decisions Made
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with tenant_id column approach
- **Payment**: Stripe integration for subscription management
- **Authentication**: JWT with tenant context
- **Demo Data**: Preserved in dedicated "demo" tenant
- **Pricing**: $2/month with 30-day free trial
- **Emails**: Resend for org verification and admin welcome

---

## üìù Notes & Considerations
- Ensure backward compatibility during migration
- Plan for data backup before major schema changes
- Consider rate limiting per tenant
- Plan for tenant-specific customizations
- Consider analytics and usage tracking per tenant

## ‚úÖ Recent Progress
- Added `lib/tenant.ts` to re-export tenant helpers, fixing import issues
- Ensured tenant filtering on: `GET /api/dashboard/data`, `GET/POST /api/employees`, `GET/POST /api/admin/payroll/periods`
- Added unit test: `GET /api/employees` validates tenant context and pagination
- Tenantized reporting APIs: attendance, payroll, departments
- Tenantized time APIs: entries, clock-in/out
- Tenantized shifts APIs: CRUD, assignments, start/end/verify-start
- Tenantized swap requests APIs: create, list, approve/reject
- Added unit tests for tenant isolation across reports/time/shifts routes
- Ran Phase 1.2 migration on Railway PostgreSQL; verified tenant_id present and non-null across key tables
- Wired Resend for org verification and admin welcome emails on signup
- Added `/api/organizations/verify` endpoint to set `is_verified=true` by `tenant_id`
