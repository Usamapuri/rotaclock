# Team Lead User Guide

This guide explains how Team Leads use the system day-to-day.

## Access & Login
- Team Lead login: `/team-lead/login`
- Credentials: Employee ID (e.g., EMP200) and password provided by Admin
- If you see the Admin login page, use the Team Lead login instead

## Navigation Overview
- Dashboard: KPIs and quick links
- Team: Members list with search/export
- Live: Real-time presence (online/break/offline) and queue stats
- Performance: KPIs + charts with date filters
- Quality: QA score list, create new evaluations
- Training: Assign/view training items
- Communications: Send team-wide messages
- Reports: Attendance summaries and CSV export

## Dashboard

- Connection status shows live updates state (SSE)

## Team Overview
- Search by name/ID/email
- Export current view to CSV
- Member row shows status and activity indicators

## Live Monitoring
- Status legend: online (active shift), break, offline
- Queue stats: available agents, calls handled, estimated wait

## Performance

- Charts:
  - Volume & Efficiency (Calls, AHT)
  - Quality & Resolution (CSAT, FCR)

## Quality

- Add score: evaluator, call ID (optional), component scores, notes
- Saved scores affect performance views

## Training
- View member assignments, status, scores
- Create assignment: title, type, due date, notes

## Communications

- See recent quality/training summaries to include in messages

## Reports

## Role Differences
- Team Leads cannot access Admin employee management and global reports
- Admin can reassign team leads and edit teams

## Tips
- Keep browser tab open for live monitoring
- Use filters to narrow charts and tables
- For large teams, export to CSV for deeper analysis

## Troubleshooting
- Canâ€™t log in: check Employee ID format (e.g., EMP200) and password; contact Admin
- No team data: ensure you are assigned as team lead to at least one active team
- Live not updating: click Reconnect; check network; try reloading the page
- Metrics empty: metrics appear when daily performance data exists
